# MATLAB SVR GUI Project  

This MATLAB-based GUI application provides an intuitive interface for data analysis and regression tasks. It integrates Support Vector Regression (SVR) with multiple kernels, offering essential features for users.  

## Key Features  

### 1. Data Visualization, Normalization, and Splitting  
- Load and display datasets using interactive plots.  
- Normalize data to enhance model performance.  
- Split data into training and testing sets.  

### 2. SVR Model Training  
- Support for multiple SVR kernels: Linear, Polynomial, and RBF.  
- Generate predictions and visualize results (2D curves, 3D surfaces).  

### 3. Performance Evaluation  
- Compute performance metrics:  
  - Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²)  
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Compare predicted vs. actual values using detailed plots.  

## Requirements  
- MATLAB R2021a or later.  
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox installed.  


## Usage  
1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project folder.  
2. Run the GUI application:  
   - Option 1: Open and run `SVR-GUI.fig` to launch the interface.  
   - Option 2: Open and run `svr.mlapp` in MATLAB App Designer.  
3. Interact with the interface to load data, train models, and visualize results.
